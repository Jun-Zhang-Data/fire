# detachment_point

---

The **detachment point** is the threshold at which losses within the pool of underlying exposures would result in a complete loss of principal for the tranche containing the relevant securitisation position. See [determination of detachment point](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32013R0575).
