# product_name

---

The FIRE schemas are designed to be standardised and not firm specific to allow for firm-independent logic to be applied to data. However, every firm has unique product names which can be extremely important for the understanding and investigation of a firm's data. This can also be particularly useful to business users when reviewing data underlying a regulatory submission.
Therefore, the **product_name** property is included to allow firms to add a proprietary string describing the product name or category for analytics and MI purposes.
