# trade_date

---

The **trade_date** represents the date the contractual terms of the financial product were agreed between parties. In the event of a multi-party (3 or more) transaction, the **trade_date** should reflect the date that all parties (or the required number, if less) had agreed. It is in date-time format in accordance with the ISO 8601 standard (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
