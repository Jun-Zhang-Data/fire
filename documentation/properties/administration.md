# administration

---

The **administration** property of a loan identifies whether the loan is being administered by the institution (as principal) or by another party (other).
The adminstrator of a loan typically is the one that collects interest, principal and escrow payments from the borrower and then remits those as payments to the various parties involved such as investors and guarantors.
