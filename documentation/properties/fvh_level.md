# fvh_level

---
**fvh_level** is represented as an integer 1, 2 or 3.

### 1 (Level 1 inputs)
[Level 1 inputs][ifrs13] are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.

A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair
value and shall be used without adjustment to measure fair value whenever
available.

### 2 (Level 2 inputs)
[Level 2 inputs][ifrs13] are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be
observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs
include the following:
1. quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.
1. quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
are not active.
1. inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability, for example:
* interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted
intervals;
* implied volatilities; and
* credit spreads.

### 3 (Level 3 inputs)
[Level 3 inputs][ifrs13] are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that
relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in
which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the
measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the
same, ie an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market
participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable
inputs shall reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when
pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
