# on_balance_sheet

---

The **on_balance_sheet** property is a boolean (true/false) indicator to determine if the relevant loan or account is an on or off-balance sheet asset or liability as reported on the balance sheet in the audited financial statements of the institution.

The risk classification of off-balance sheet items can be found in ANNEX I of the [CRR][crr].
