The **attachment point** is the threshold at which losses within the pool of underlying exposures would start to be allocated to the relevant securitisation position. See [determination of attachment point](https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/single-rulebook/interactive-single-rulebook/14412).
