Tests and documentation always be improved, in particular, we are looking for assistance with the following:

# TODO
- [ ] Add more documentation files to remove elements from the list of exceptions found in: `test_docs.test_property_has_docs`
- [ ] Add more detailed docs testing to ensure enums have 'fuller' descriptions (not just headers), ordering and inclusion in 'enum trees'
- [ ] Update documentation in places where it says *Needs definition*
- [ ] Testing of nested objects like `security.index_composition` or `loan.customers`
